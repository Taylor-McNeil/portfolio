# Clearwater Library API System

Welcome to the Clearwater Library API System! This portfolio showcases the development of a comprehensive API system designed to support a library's digital functionalities, from managing book records to providing personalized recommendations. This project demonstrates expertise in API development, technical documentation, Docs-as-Code automation, and SDK integration. Explore the live demo and more detailed documentation [here](https://taylor-mcneil.github.io/portfolio/).



## Overview
The Clearwater Library API System includes several interrelated projects, each contributing to a comprehensive API and documentation ecosystem for managing a libraryâ€™s digital resources. This portfolio begins with foundational API development and evolves into advanced documentation, SDK, and automation projects, reflecting the full lifecycle of a robust, developer-friendly API system.

- **Library Management REST API**: The foundational API for managing library book data, supporting CRUD operations. This project demonstrates API design and documentation essentials, including versioning and error handling.

- **GraphQL API for Flexible Data Access**: Expands the REST API by providing flexible, query-driven access to the library's data, catering to developer needs for customization and showcasing differences in documentation approaches between REST and GraphQL.

- **Book Recommendation Microservice**: Adds a personalized recommendation layer using AI, enriching the library system with user-centered functionality and further extending API documentation requirements.

- **SDK Development, Documentation, and Interactive Tutorial**: Introduces a developer toolkit that simplifies API integration. The SDK features well-structured documentation and an interactive tutorial, enhancing developer onboarding and usability.

- **Docs-as-Code and CI/CD Pipeline:** Establishes a Docs-as-Code workflow, automating quality checks and deployment for consistent, high-quality documentation updates. This project highlights automation and continuous integration practices.

- **CDC Integration and Release Notes**: Implements Change Data Capture (CDC) to support real-time updates in the library catalog. This project includes detailed release notes segmented by audience, demonstrating a structured approach to update communication.

Each component is documented and designed with developers in mind, providing tools and guidelines to seamlessly integrate and use the Clearwater Library API System.
